        Our double-anonymous peer review process ensures objectivity, as authors and reviewers remain anonymous to each other. We follow a rigorous review system to uphold the quality, credibility, and originality of published research.

        <br>
        <br>
Each submitted manuscript undergoes an initial editorial screening to check for compliance with ethical standards and manuscript preparation guidelines. If suitable, the manuscript proceeds to peer review, where a minimum of two independent experts evaluate its coherence and structure, methodology and findings, originality, comprehensiveness, and relevance to current literature.

<br>
<br>
Authors are required to revise their work based on reviewer feedback before final acceptance. Reviewers play a vital role in maintaining scholarly standards, and we encourage them to refer to our Reviewerâ€™s Guide for detailed instructions. This structured process ensures the integrity of academic publishing and contributes to the advancement of knowledge.
